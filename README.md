# primitive-array-slice

This project uses two methods to slice primitive arrays in Java.

**Method 1**: sliceArray uses Arrays.copyOfRange() method.

**Method2**: sliceArrayUsingStream uses IntStream.range() method.

**Note:** In both of these methods startIndex is inclusive and lastIndex is exclusive.
